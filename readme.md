an opinionated way to use quickfix/location list

## features
* offer some rhs for quickfix buffer: open an entry in a split win, preview an entry
* toggle between loclist and qflist window
* no stacking nvim's qflist/loclist, manage history by sting itself
* switch/clear qf/loc history

## status
* it just works(tm)
* it is feature-frozen

## usecases
* to replace `setqflist()`
* to replace `vim.diagnostic.setloclist()`
